Step-by-Step Instructions

Identify the Core Problem: From the key_events list, identify the event with the highest confidence_score that likely has the biggest impact on the user.

Devise a Solution: Brainstorm routines that could alleviate the identified problem (e.g., stress, lack of sleep). Consider the user_preferences to prioritize activities the user is likely to enjoy.

Create an Action Plan: Detail the brainstormed routine into concrete actionable_steps and plan any helpful tool_calls.

Generate Final JSON: Based on the steps above, complete the JSON object according to the final output schema.
